(ns content-address.archive
  "Putting a document where a copy can be fetched, and proving it landed.

  The archive is Location, not authority: it stores bytes under the CID the
  bytes already have, and it recomputes the digest on receipt (422 on
  mismatch). Losing it costs availability, never identity — anyone holding
  the bytes can re-derive the same address (ADR-2608039000's削除テスト).

  `publish!` is fail-closed. It PUTs, GETs the object back, and compares the
  returned bytes to what it sent. A 201 alone is not evidence: the failure
  this guards against is a manifest recording an address nothing serves.

  ⚠ `PUT /ipfs/{cid}` accepts raw CIDv1 only. A dag-cbor identity must be
  archived under the raw CID of the same bytes — one object, two codecs."
