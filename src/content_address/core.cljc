(ns content-address.core
  "Content addressing, as pure functions over octets.

  A document's identity is its bytes. This namespace turns bytes into a
  CIDv1 string, reads a CIDv1 string back into a digest, and answers the
  three questions an application manifest has to answer:

    identity  — `:kotoba.app/bundle-cid`   the raw CIDv1 of the document
    naming    — `:kotoba.app/latest`       the key-derived IPNS name (k51…)
    location  — `:published`/`:graph`      where a copy answered a GET

  Location is a retrieval hint. It is never the identity, so a manifest that
  carries only an https URL is NOT addressed (`addressed?` says so).

  No hashing here — hashing is platform work (`content-address.digest`), and
  no I/O — that is `content-address.archive`. Everything below is a pure
  function of octet vectors, so both runtimes run the same code and the
  tests do not need a network.

  ⚠ IPLD paths (`/ipld/{cid}/a/b`) are resolution paths through a DAG, not
  locations. \"Not path-based\" constrains identity, not traversal."
